# Penguin Weight Estimation using Linear Regression in R

## Overview

This project utilizes the linear regression method in R to estimate the weight of different penguin types in Antarctica. The analysis is performed using the Palmer Penguins dataset, which provides comprehensive information about various penguin species.

## Objective

The primary objective of this project is to employ linear regression techniques to model and predict the weights of different penguin types based on relevant features from the Palmer Penguins dataset.

## Methods Used

- Linear regression analysis
- R programming language

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the Palmer Penguins dataset, accessible at [https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/). The dataset includes measurements and attributes of different penguin species in Antarctica.
